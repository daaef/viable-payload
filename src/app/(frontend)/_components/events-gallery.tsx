Adenex had initiated this project two decades ago, and it was heartwarming to witness the fruition of their efforts while planting new indigenous trees on previously barren land. Adenex generously provided food, accommodation, and transportation for the volunteers over the weekend. This experience highlighted the profound impact of past initiatives and the ongoing commitment to preserving nature. For more information about Adenex's tree planting activities, visit their website.",
